### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div>Some HTML code I'm proud of</div>
```
```css
:root{
--White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
--Lightgray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
--Grayishblue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
--Darkblue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```

### Continued development

i aspire to increase my understanding in the basic html and css and  the deep understanding about javascript, and python.and to my own view i think you should add short video on how to go about the first project cause alot of us are just new to this environment .also abig thanks to frontend Mentor for providing a platform for us to practice this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects.
